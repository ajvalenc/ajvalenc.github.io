I am a PhD candidate in electrical and computer engineering at the University of Ottawa and member of the [SMART](http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~ppayeur/SMART/) research group led by [Pierre Payeur](http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~ppayeur/). My research interests center primarily on the fields of robotics, vision and learning, with a specific focus on the modeling and perception of deformable objects in robotic manipulation scenarios.
{style="text-align: justify;"}

My current work aims to develop novel methodologies to improve the understanding and handling of deformable objects by robots in unstructured environments. I am especially interested in contributing to the advancement of autonomous robotic systems, with the ultimate goal of enhancing their functionality and efficiency in real-world applications.
