  abstract = {This paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey of recent advancements in modelling and autonomous manipulation of non-rigid objects. It first summarizes the recent advances in sensing and modelling of such objects with a focus on describing the methods and technologies used to measure their shape and estimate their material and physical properties. Formal representations considered to predict the deformation resulting from manipulation of non-rigid objects are then investigated. The third part provides a survey of planning and control strategies exploited to operate dexterous robotic systems while performing various tasks on objects made of different non-rigid materials.}

  abstract = {The intelligent handling of deformable objects by robotic manipulators has enabled the automation of various delicate or labour-intensive tasks, but still faces many challenges when it comes to more complex situations. In particular, the lack of a general framework to manage deformation makes it difficult to manipulate unknown objects, especially in the 3D case. This work aims to provide a path forward to solve some of the challenges pertaining to the robotic manipulation of deformable objects and integrate these solutions in a flexible system able to manipulate various deformable objects in a taskindependent way.}

  abstract = {PID controllers are widely used in the control of industrial processes. Proper performance of the PID compensator is achieved when optimal parameters values of the PID are identified. Particle based Optimization algorithms are commonly used in solving parameter optimization problems. In this work, a particle based optimization algorithm is proposed. The methodology improves the performance of the Particle Filtering Optimization algorithm by considering the EnKF as part of the PFO algorithm. Two structures are considered in this study: PFO with the EnKF and SIR filter and PFO with the EnKF. Simulation results show that the inclusion of the EnKF improves the performance of the PFO algorithm even with a small set of particles and the computational time demand of the combined methodology is slightly increased.}

  abstract = {Automatic identification of elevated human body temperature has become a topic of interest in health-care monitoring systems. The use of a thermal imaging device recently gained in popularity for screening Covid-19 infected subjects in public transportation and public places, but can also be transposed to a variety of domains. Scientific studies support that certain thermal imaging systems can be used to reliably measure surface skin temperature in a stable environment. In this paper we propose a fever detection system that expands the capabilities provided with single thermal sensor by integrating two thermal cameras equipped with nonuniformity correction shutters and a blackbody temperature reference source. The system automatically detects a subject's face and forehead as well as the surface of the blackbody, compensates for the error arising as the person is not on the same plane as the blackbody, and triggers an alarm if the body temperature is higher than a predefined threshold. Experiments demonstrate that the fever detection system succeeds to achieve a confidence margin of {\textpm}0.43{$^\circ$}C.}

Current techniques for modeling deformable objects are inflexible and suffer from discrepancies with actual behaviors when assumptions on their material are not properly fulfilled, or when objects can only be observed from limited viewpoints. Deformable object models require close integration between computer vision, deep learning and robotics. In this work, a framework for modeling 3D deformable objects from multi-view images is presented to support robotic manipulation.}

  abstract = {In general, robot grasping approaches are based on the usage of multi-finger grippers. However, when large size objects need to be manipulated vacuum grippers are preferred, instead of finger based grippers. This paper aims to estimate the best picking place for a two suction cups vacuum gripper, when planar objects with an unknown size and geometry are considered. The approach is based on the estimation of geometric properties of object's shape from a partial cloud of points (a single 3D view), in such a way that combine with considerations of a theoretical model to generate an optimal contact point that minimizes the vacuum force needed to guarantee a grasp. Experimental results in real scenarios are presented to show the validity of the proposed approach.}

This work explores various sensing and modeling strategies for tracking the 3D shape of objects during manipulation, allowing for more accurate and responsive planning and control of robotic manipulators. These approaches are evaluated in terms of their ability to correctly capture the behaviour of non-rigid objects as well as their computational complexity, which is strongly constrained by the need for real-time control on robotic platforms with limited computing power.}

  abstract = {Dexterous robotic manipulation of non-rigid objects is a challenging problem but   necessary to explore as robots are increasingly interacting with more complex environments in which such objects are frequently present. In particular, common manipulation tasks such as molding clay to a target shape or picking fruits and vegetables for use in the kitchen, require a high-level understanding of the scene and objects. Commonly, the behavior of non-rigid objects is described by a model. Although, well-established modeling techniques are difficult to apply in robotic tasks since objects and their properties are unknown in such unstructured environments. This work proposes a sensing and modeling framework to measure the 3D shape deformation of non-rigid objects. Unlike traditional methods, this framework explores data-driven learning techniques focused on shape representation and deformation dynamics prediction using a graph-based approach. The proposal is validated experimentally, analyzing the performance of the representation model to capture the current state of the non-rigid object shape. In addition, the performance of the prediction model is analyzed in terms of its ability to produce future states of the non-rigid object shape   due to the manipulation actions of the robotic system. The results suggest that the representation model is able to produce graphs that closely capture the deformation behavior of the non-rigid object. Whereas, the prediction model produces visually plausible graphs when short-term predictions are required.},

  abstract = {Modeling deformable objects is an important preliminary step for performing robotic manipulation tasks with more autonomy and dexterity. Currently, generalization capabilities in unstructured environments using analytical approaches are limited, mainly due to the lack of adaptation to changes in the object shape and properties. Therefore, this paper proposes the design and implementation of a data-driven approach, which combines machine learning techniques on graphs to estimate and predict the state and transition dynamics of deformable objects with initially undefined shape and material characteristics. The learned object model is trained using RGB-D sensor data and evaluated in terms of its ability to estimate the current state of the object shape, in addition to predicting future states with the goal to plan and support the manipulation actions of a robotic hand.}

This is particularly challenging for non-rigid objects, as they exhibit complex dynamics with large degrees of freedom. This work presents a methodology to learn deformation models of 3D elastic objects based on graph networks. Our approach exploits physical reasoning by introducing soft constraints into the loss function during training. We evaluate the proposed method in a simulation framework developed for robotic manipulation tasks. Results show that such a physics-informed model is able to predict more accurate object motions with less data than a purely data-driven based model.}
